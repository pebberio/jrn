# jrn.js
Node Module to create issues in jira by ease

BETA: jrn is working as expected.
It creates an issue, assigns a sprint and execute an optional post transition. 

![Screenshot](./screenshot.gif)

## Requirements
* [node](https://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation
```bash
npm install;
```

### config 
```bash
# create your custom config
cp config/default.toml.dist config/default.toml;

# modify your local configuration
vim config/default.toml;
```


#### Profiles

You can define profiles in your config file.
Simply add a postfix to the categries as mentioned in the 
[config/default.toml.dist](config/default.toml.dist) like *[Jira_profile]* and *[Sprint_profile]*

A profile will get active, when the environment variable `JRN_PRPFILE` ist set.
```
# export the profile
export JRN_PROFILE=myprofile

# or prefix command with profile
JRN_PROFILE=myprofile jrn
```

This will give us the possibility to make use of jrn for different instanzes, projects...

##### Default key:value fallback
If an key:value pair is not set in a profile, there is a fallback and 
the values from default section will be used


### create alias
```bash
# add "jrn" as alias to the shell
echo "alias jrn='~/workspace/jrn/bin/jrn'" >> ~/.bashrc

# Test des Alias
## reload bashrc and call jrn
source ~/.bashrc
jrn
```

## TODOS
* Build + Package to make npm install pebberio/jrn globally possible
* Docker Container
* helper tools, to identify rapidViewId, sprintCustomFieldId, projects and issueTypes
* config wizard
* config verification
* config by env vars
* config by ~/.jrn/config
* config and execution with profiles like aws-cli
* refactoring / cleanup / tweaks
* error handling
    * Jira not accessable
    * wrong credentials / user not authorized or allowed to request X
    * Sprint customField not available in IssueScheme of Project or not assigned to chosen IssueType (isse creation failes)
    * Project does not have given IssueType (take use advantages of profiles)
* check if rapidView is really necessary as config param....


### NOTICE max 50
Per default, api results are limited to an amount of 50. More is not handled, and might never be handled.
Let's say you have more than 50+ Projects configured, you'll only get the first 50 to choose from.
When you'll have configured that huge amount, i would prefer the web gui 
or take advantage of profiles to create issues with ease from cli.
